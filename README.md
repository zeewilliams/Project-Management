## 📘 Introduction

This project was initiated by the City of Merrilton to build a mobile payment portal integrating three legacy billing systems—utilities, public housing, and code enforcement. These systems previously operated in silos, leading to issues like refund misapplication and incorrect address mailings. The project aimed to deliver a unified platform before the end of the fiscal year, operating under a fixed labor budget of $105,200. A state technology grant was also available for equipment purchases, expiring June 30.

Partway through the project, a new project manager (you) was brought in to stabilize the effort after delays and misalignments emerged. Your mission: restructure the schedule, perform earned value analysis, mitigate risks, and deliver within budget and time constraints.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Integrate three city billing systems into a unified mobile platform
- Manage scope and timeline using a Gantt-based project schedule
- Monitor cost and performance with Earned Value Analysis (EVA)
- Identify and mitigate risks to avoid grant expiration and scope creep
- Deliver project within the $105,200 IT labor budget

## 🧪 Project Walkthrough

### ✅ Step 1: Review Scope & Constraints

- Project start: First Monday of March  
- Goal: Completion by June 30 (City fiscal year-end)  
- Budget: $105,200 (2,104 hours @ $50/hr)  
- Equipment funded by state technology grant (expires June 30)

---

### ✅ Step 2: Build and Adjust Gantt Timeline

- Gantt chart created using official WBS and Smartsheet
- Realigned predecessor dependencies and durations
- Created clear task groupings by system:
  - Utilities
  - Code Enforcement
  - Public Housing
  - Payment Processing

### ✅ Step 3: Perform Earned Value Analysis (EVA)

| Team      | Budget ($) | EV ($) | AC ($) | PV ($) | CV ($) | CPI | SV ($) | SPI |
|-----------|------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|-----|--------|-----|
| Team 1    | 9,200      | 6,176  | 6,800  | 7,360  | -624   | 0.91| -1,184 | 0.84|
| Team 2    | 17,600     | 4,616  | 4,500  | 5,867  | +116   | 1.03| -1,250 | 0.79|
| Team 3    | 24,000     | 4,123  | 4,500  | 5,838  | -377   | 0.92| -1,715 | 0.71|
| Team 4    | 21,200     | 5,472  | 5,350  | 8,296  | +122   | 1.02| -2,824 | 0.66|
| Team 5    | 33,200     | 2,287  | 2,950  | 1,606  | -663   | 0.78| +681   | 1.42|

> Total project CPI: **0.94**, SPI: **0.78**  
> Cost variance = -$1,425.16 | Schedule variance = -6,291.77

### ✅ Step 4: Analyze Burndown Chart

The 75-day burndown chart shows a delay trend that began as early as day 5. By day 16, only ~20% of tasks were complete, compared to the ~33% expected. Module customization, testing, and procurement were the primary bottlenecks.

### ✅ Step 5: Apply Risk Mitigation Strategy

| Risk                                     | Strategy                                                  |
|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Grant funds expiring                     | Prioritize purchases before June 30                       |
| Module customizations falling behind     | Reassign resources from training/setup to development     |
| Citizen communication gaps               | Finalize outreach via email and bill inserts              |
| Staff resistance to system changes       | Early hands-on training and feedback loops                |
